# Project Managegement App

> 2 versions of an advanced project management system built in Java for a hypothetical construction company to keep track of their ongoing and completed contracts.

#### Versions
There are 2 versions of the software in this repo. One reads from and writes to .txt files that are also in thus repo, the other interacts with a mySQL database. Their functionality is identical.

#### Functionality
The robust system allows for the creation of new projects and clients. Staff are assigned to respective projects. Each project contains a wealth of relevant data pertaining to the contract specifications. Invoices can be compiled and projects can be marked as complete. Error-checking and handling is extensive in both versions of the program to ensure that the database and .txt files can never be corrupted.
